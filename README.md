## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [DAPR CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)
- Redis

Alternatively, you can use DevContainers and Visual Studio Code for local development. Opening the project within a devContainer will automatically install all the required tools and extensions.


## Execution

We use Make commands to automate the build and deployment process. You can run the following command to see the available commands:

```bash
make help
```
The following commands are available:
```bash
help                 ðŸ’¬ This help message :)
init-dapr            ðŸ§¹ Initialize Dapr
